        <p>Located near the coast of Sihanoukville, Cambodia, <b>Koh Rong</b> is famous for its serene beauty.

        <h2>How to Get Here</h2>
        <p>To get from Sihanoukville to Koh Rong, or to get from Sihanoukville to Koh Rong Samloem, you can take one of the 5 modern ferry companies - Speed Ferry Cambodia, Island Speed Boat Cambodia, Buva Sea, Angkor Speed Ferry, and GTVC. It will take about 40 minutes to get to your destination if it's the first stop. If the boat first stops elsewhere, it may take 1 hour or so. All services leave from the Ochheuteal pier in Sihanoukville and go to the main tourist beaches on the islands (Koh Touch on Koh Rong, and Saracen Bay on Koh Rong Samloem).</p>

        <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
        <p>We would say that the best time to visit Koh Rong and its sister island, Koh Rong Samloem, is between the middle of November and the start of May. During these months, you will have beautiful hot days (25°C - 40°C) with very little cloud and low humidity. Although the temperatures on Koh Rong do not vary much over the course of a year, humidity on the island varies significantly, with April and May being particularly humid and December and January very dry. The amount of sunshine is very dependent on the season, with the dry season having significantly more sun than the rainy season.</p>

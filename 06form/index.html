        <p>Cambodian arts and crafts are rich and diverse. From the <b>impressive stone carvings</b> of the Angkor period through to <strong>exquisite silk weaving</strong>, Cambodian or Khmer art is, without a doubt, one of the most richly diverse in the world.

        <h2>Pottery and Ceramics</h2>
